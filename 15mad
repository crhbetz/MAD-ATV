# this is only needed on some weird systems (this was a t95s1 i saw) that have /system/bin/ mounted as tmpfs for some reason
# the box in question was installed via rc1, so who knows what bugs were in it lol
# anyways, you should not need this, but if you cant add files to /system/bin without them going away, add this to /system/etc/init.d/
